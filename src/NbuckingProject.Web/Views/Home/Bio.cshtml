        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
            I'm Nicholas Sean Buckingham, born in 1986 in Phoenix, Arizona. I grew up in the Valley with my sister Jennifer, 
            and my parents Bonnie and Philip Buckingham. My mother worked as a pet groomer, while my father was an electrical 
            engineer specializing in design engineering.

        <h2>Early Inspirations</h2>
        <p>
            My passion for technology came from my father, who constantly brought home fascinating new tech—touch screens, 
            DVD readers and burners, and all sorts of cutting-edge devices. His enthusiasm was contagious, and I found myself 
            drawn deeper into the world of technology.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond my father's influence, I was inspired by Disney's creativity and innovation, the collaborative problem-solving 
            of F.I.R.S.T. robotics club, and technologists like <a href="https://www.tinkergeek.com" target="_blank">Alex Younts</a>, 
            whose work showed me how technical knowledge could be shared and celebrated.

        <h2>Military Service</h2>
        <p>
            When I was 20, I enlisted in the United States Air Force. It was a pivotal time in my life—I had just lost my sister 
            Jennifer, and the Air Force provided structure, purpose, and the opportunity to serve my country while developing my 
            technical skills.

        <h2>Career</h2>
        <p>
            Over the years, I've built a career focused on systems engineering, infrastructure automation, and modern DevOps practices. 
            My experience spans SCCM/MECM deployment and management, software packaging, PowerShell scripting, Kubernetes orchestration, 
            and cloud infrastructure.
        </p>
        <p>
            I enjoy solving complex technical challenges, automating repetitive tasks, and building reliable systems that just work.

        <h2>Family</h2>
        <p>
            I'm married to Kinga Henryka Buckingham (born 1982), and together we have a wonderful daughter, Nicole, who is now 3 years old. 
            Watching her curiosity and energy reminds me why I fell in love with technology in the first place—the joy of discovery and creation.

        <h2>This Site</h2>
        <p>
            This website is both a portfolio and a playground—a place to showcase projects, document technical explorations, and share what 
            I've learned. If you're curious about how it was built, check out the <a asp-action="Technical">technical details</a>.
